# üìà Price Optimization Macro with Dashboard

Welcome to the **Price Optimization Macro** project! üéâ This repository contains an Excel-based solution that leverages macros to optimize product prices based on demand, competitor prices, and business logic. Additionally, a dynamic dashboard has been created to visualize insights and trends effectively.

## üìù Project Overview

This project focuses on **price optimization** by applying business rules and logic to dynamically adjust prices. The macro processes data and generates optimized prices while providing actionable insights through visualizations.

### üîß Business Logic

The macro uses the following conditions to adjust prices:

| **Condition**                     | **Action**                | **Priority** |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| If demand is high                 | Increase price by 5%      | 1            |
| If competitor's price is lower    | Decrease price by 3%      | 2            |
| If demand is low                  | Decrease price by 7%      | 3            |
| If profit margin is below 20%     | Increase price by 2%      | 4            |

## üìä Features

1. **Macro-Based Price Optimization**:
   - Automatically adjusts product prices based on demand, competitor pricing, and profit margins.
   - Outputs optimized prices in a new Excel sheet.

2. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - **Line Chart**: Visualizes old vs. new prices over time.
   - **Price vs. Demand Chart**: Highlights the relationship between pricing and demand.
   - **Demand vs. Market Season Chart**: Shows demand trends across different market conditions like holidays, summer sales, Black Friday, etc.

3. **Synthetic Data Generation**:
   - The dataset used for this project was generated synthetically using a Python script, ensuring flexibility for testing and analysis.
